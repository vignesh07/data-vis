My experiments with d3js and other visualization techniques

------------------------------------------------------------

I am trying my hand with <a href="http://d3js.org/"> d3js</a> (and boy is it beautiful) and this repo will be the go-to for all my data visualization work. Contains whatever I have recently visualized. The repo is protected using a Creative Commons license, so if you're using anything that's mine (unless I've credited someone on the code/idea/viz-chart), please provide attribution.

Cheers.
